0.001: Created the repo, worked on a number of things, including our plan, populate_block_cast_action and our level builder.
0.002: Worked on getting populate_block_cast_action and our level builder working, and wrote 0.001 in the changelog. - Jared
        Created the platformer folder for use in creating a combined version of the rfk and cycle projects. 
            I'm hoping to turn this into a version of rfk that uses scripting so that we can use it in the future for the rest of our project.

0.003: I continued working on turning this into a version of rfk that uses scripting.
        I wasn't very successful in this. 
        I temporarily moved the scripting files out of the main folder to essentially rewrite them with the basics of rfk, the functions from director.py.
        I started working on set_pc_velocity_action in scripting, who's rfk counterpart is the _get_inputs function in director.py, with the cycles counterpart of control_actors_action.py in scripting.
        I think I did some other stuff, but I can't remember what I did. 
        Currently the program is running.

0.004: We decided to ditch our idea of basing things off of RFK, and are switching to a new model based on Cycles with a side of RFK. Created references folder

0.005: Moved platformer and our previous Cycles program into references.

0.006: Imported a fresh copy of our Cycles game to use as a base for our new program.
