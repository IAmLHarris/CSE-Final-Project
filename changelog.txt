This is where we'll have our change log. Remember to record what you do so you
can write it here!
0.001: Created the repo, worked on a number of things, including our plan, populate_block_cast_action and our level builder.
0.002: Worked on getting populate_block_cast_action and our level builder working, and wrote 0.001 in the changelog. - Jared
        Created the platformer folder for use in creating a combined version of the rfk and cycle projects. 
            I'm hoping to turn this into a version of rfk that uses scripting so that we can use it in the future for the rest of our project.

0.003: I continued working on turning this into a version of rfk that uses scripting.
        I wasn't very successful in this. 
        I temporarily moved the scripting files out of the main folder to essentially rewrite them with the basics of rfk, the functions from director.py.
        I started working on set_pc_velocity_action in scripting, who's rfk counterpart is the _get_inputs function in director.py, with the cycles counterpart of control_actors_action.py in scripting.
        I think I did some other stuff, but I can't remember what I did. 
        Currently the program is running.

0.004: We decided to ditch our idea of basing things off of RFK, and are switching to a new model based on Cycles with a side of RFK. Created references folder

0.005: Moved platformer and our previous Cycles program into references.

0.006: Imported a fresh copy of our Cycles game to use as a base for our new program.
        Jared wrote in the plan and changelog.
        Liam added the resources.py file to the shared folder.
        Liam removed some code from the second player.
        Kaelyn removed code from the scripting and services folders' files regarding the second player
        Liam worked on converting the player to use RFK movement rather than Cycles movement.

0.007: Liam continued working on converting the player to use RFK style movement.
        Jared changed a couple of items in the constants.py, some words in resources.py, and continued working in the plan and changelog.
        
0.008: L continues to suffer, but successfully made populate_block_cast_action function as working! 
        As coded as of writing, populate_block_cast_action works. It doesn't really do anything ingame, but it does pull from the level file and print as it works.
                To note- If you make a level, you need to add it's file extension name to the constants file. Feel free to change it if you want to, but trust me when I say, this was the simplest way of doing it. 

0.009: Watch in real time as you can move the player sprite around pixel by pixel! 
        The functionality is that of our old RFK file, and oh my goodness, I'm so happy I might cry. Never before have I been so happy to move around a black void as a single Q. Moving the character model is no longer involuntary, holding down the key lets you move.
