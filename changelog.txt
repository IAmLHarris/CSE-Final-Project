        Created the platformer folder for use in creating a combined version of the rfk and cycle projects. 
            I'm hoping to turn this into a version of rfk that uses scripting so that we can use it in the future for the rest of our project.
0.003: I continued working on turning this into a version of rfk that uses scripting.
        I wasn't very successful in this. 
        I temporarily moved the scripting files out of the main folder to essentially rewrite them with the basics of rfk, the functions from director.py.
        I started working on set_pc_velocity_action in scripting, who's rfk counterpart is the _get_inputs function in director.py, with the cycles counterpart of control_actors_action.py in scripting.
        I think I did some other stuff, but I can't remember what I did. 
        Currently the program is running.
0.004: Changing to a new model, created references folder
0.005: Moved platformer and our previous Cycles program into references.
