This is a file for developers to read. The numbers that are added to half of CELL_SIZE in handle_collisions_action, "(8 + CELL_SIZE / 2)" are there so that the collision works better. 
It's been fine tuned with the current cell size to make sure that it'll get as close to the player as possible without impeding the player.
